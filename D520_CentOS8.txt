CentOS 8.1 on a Dell Latitude D520
"abandon hope all ye who enter here"

introduction:

As part of my ongoing efforts, and related diversions, since 4/3 to create an OpenStack cluster with most of the hardware I have kicking around, I was working on the oldest member of my stable about a week ago, and thought to try to get my ASUSTEK MB169B+ DisplayLink display to work with the D520.

The DisplayLink source code wouldn't compile due to some library being too old in CentOS 7.7. Since I'd already moved to CentOS 8.1 on several of the would-be OpenStack cluster members for various reasons, I figured I'd installed it on the D520 to see if the unfulfilled dependency for DisplayLink could be addressed that way.

issues:
1. poor graphics performance
2. Broadcom BCM4401 Ethernet NIC not recognized (b44)
3. preferred TP-Link TL-WN725N (v1) wifi dongle not recognized (rtl8188eus)

resolutions and workarounds
1. poor graphics performance

hallmark was stuttery mouse movement, delayed responsiveness, and slow compositing in Gnome
journalctl showed that /usr/lib64/dri/i915_dri.so was not being found
there's is no package available in any of the following repos which provides this DRI lib
  CentOS-8 - AppStream
  CentOS-8 - Base
  CentOS-8 - PowerTools
  ELRepo.org Community Enterprise Linux Repository - el8
  Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux 8 - Playground - x86_64
  CentOS-8 - Extras
  RPM Fusion for EL 8 - Free - Updates
  RPM Fusion for EL 8 - Nonfree - Updates

efforts to build the missing component
  external-mesa (https://github.com/intel/external-mesa)
    fails on requirement for libdrm >= 2.4.100 (CentOS delivers 2.4.98)
  libdrm (https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/drm)
    fails on requirement for *fill this in*

subsequent crazy idea
  while it goes against everything I know about Linux, I figured the worst that could happen is that it wouldn't work:
    copy the i915_dri.so object from a CentOS 7.7 system and just see what happens
    it turns out this works - Xorg loads the object without complaint, and performance is greatly improved

2. Broadcom BCM4401

The Broadcom BCM4401 chipset in the D520 requires the b44.ko kernel module
RHEL decided to stop including this aged 10/100 NIC in the modules delivered in CentOS 8.x

see if a different kernel includes it
  I'd happened on info previously that the ELrepo repo includes newer mainline kernels for CentOS 7.x, so I thought I'd check this out for CentOS 8.1
  ELrepo does indeed provide kernel-ml 5.6.4, which is dramatically newer than the 4.18.0 provided with CentOS 8.1
  I installed this kernel, and two devices started working without further ado
    Broadcom Inc. and subsidiaries BCM4401-B0 100Base-TX (b44)
    ALFA AWUS036NHR (rtl8188ru)

due to other issues running the much newer kernel, I decided to try compiling the b44 kernel module under the default CentOS 8.1 kernel
